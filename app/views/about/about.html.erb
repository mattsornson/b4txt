  <p><span id="internal-source-marker_0.3550660968758166"><strong>Founding:</strong></span> <br><br>
    Beerfortextbooks.com is the brainchild of Karol Grzesiak . Was built by Derek Hopper, Nate West,<br>
    Matt Sornson, and Ryan Boucher. <br>
    <br>
    We were born at <a href="http://kalamazoo.startupweekend.org/">Start Up Weekend Kalamazoo</a> on March 25th 2011. A start up event that gives you two days to build a functioning business. <br>
    <br>
    We built beerfortextbooks.com because we noticed that most of the money we got for selling our textbooks at the end of the semester was going right into beer. So why not cut out the middle? <br><br>
    <a href="http://www.beerfortextbooks.com/">beerfortextbooks.com</a> lets you see exactly how much of your favorite beer your textbooks are worth. Beer is better than books period. <br>
